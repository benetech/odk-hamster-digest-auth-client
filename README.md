# Digest Authentication Client Helpers for ODK Hamster

This library is based on code from this tutorial, by [Eugen Paraschiv](http://www.baeldung.com/author/eugen/)
[RestTemplate with Digest Authentication](http://www.baeldung.com/resttemplate-digest-authentication)

The purpose of the library is to allow a REST client to connect to ODK Hamster using HTTP digest authentication.

You could probably use it for other HTTP digest client authentication purposes.
